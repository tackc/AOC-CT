# Advent of Code - 2020

- This project is to practice coding with a few of my coworkers. We are working through problems on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website. Alongside solving their problems, we are each creating one problem of our own each week.

## Jest

- I am using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing. To install the command line tools, type `sudo npm install -g jest` if you're on a Mac or `npm install -g jest` if you're on Windows.

- To run tests, navigate to the directory where they are located and type `jest`. You will see your test results in the terminal window.
  - An alternate option is to run `jest <directory>/test.js --watch`
  - `Control + C` will stop the test
